AI-Powered Employee Role Fit and Career Progression Analysis

Overview

Employees must be placed in the most suitable job roles to maximize performance, job satisfaction, and productivity within an organization. Traditional role assignment methods often result in job mismatches, leading to inefficiencies and increased turnover rates. To address this challenge, we propose an AI-Powered Employee Role Fit and Career Progression Analysis system that leverages machine learning techniques to optimize role assignments. This system analyzes employee characteristics in relation to job roles using large language models (LLMs), ensuring a data-driven, accurate, and efficient approach to workforce management.

Methodology

This project utilizes unsupervised machine learning techniques, including:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Captures linear relationships in the dataset, reducing dimensionality and generating feature weights.

Deep Neural Network-based Autoencoder: Captures both linear and non-linear relationships, reducing dimensionality and scoring individuals based on job suitability.

Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash Model: Extracts key job-related features from job descriptions.

BERT-based Sentence Embedding Model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2): Measures similarity between job descriptions and employee characteristics using cosine similarity.

Skill Gap Analysis: Identifies missing skills and provides personalized career development recommendations.

Role Fit Analysis

Employee Data Processing: Collects employee technical skills, soft skills, educational qualifications, certifications, experience, and job history.

Job Description Analysis: Extracts key features from job descriptions using LLMs.

Similarity Calculation:

Computes cosine similarity between job descriptions and employee profiles.

Uses BERT embeddings to generate role suitability scores.

Role Assignment Optimization:

Assigns employees to roles based on their job suitability scores.

Provides recommendations for employees to enhance qualifications and prepare for future roles.

Evaluation & Results

To validate the proposed approach, we compared it against the organization's existing job similarity-based assessment for role transitions.

Job dissimilarity was derived from the existing method using the formula:



The proposed approach showed a negative correlation of -0.23 with job dissimilarity, indicating a moderate inverse relationship.

This suggests that as employee scores increase, job dissimilarity decreases, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Benefits

✅ Data-Driven Decision-Making: Optimizes role assignments based on real employee data.
✅ Improved Employee Satisfaction: Reduces mismatches, ensuring employees are placed in roles where they can thrive.
✅ Career Progression & Development: Provides employees with clear pathways for growth by identifying skill gaps.
✅ Enhanced Workforce Efficiency: Reduces turnover rates and boosts overall organizational productivity.

Conclusion

The AI-powered role fit analysis provides organizations with a robust data-driven framework for optimal role assignment and career planning. By leveraging unsupervised machine learning, BERT-based similarity measures, and skill gap analysis, this system enhances workforce efficiency and aligns employees with roles that maximize their potential.
